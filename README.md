# boarding-passes
Sorter for boarding passes and itinerary generator

## Description
Boarding Passes is a simple tool for sorting transportation tickets in a subsequent order and to output an itinerary that is human-readable.

## Prerequisites
- Apache
- PHP 7.2
- composer

## Installation
- Clone the git repository
- Install dependencies (composer install)
- Open application in the local browser (or use command php -a <file>)
- For customization update sample.json, but keep the structure

## Notes
Two design patterns were used, Builder and Factory. Coding principles like SOLID, KISS and DRY were taken into consideration, but there is still place for improvement. Then, PSR-2 (manual without an IDE checker) and PSR-4 were used for standardization.
